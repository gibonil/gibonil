## ☄️ Eya nice to meet ya ! ☄️

### ☀️ What am I doing on Github ? ☀️

  **👋 Hi everyone, I'm GIBONI Lucas**, a PhD student in climate sciences at Institut des Géosciences de l'Environement (IGE) in Grenoble. 
My PhD focuses on the aerosol-cloud interaction in Arctic through the use of WRF-CHEM. As you may know we are unclear about the contribution of clouds to the actual warming of Arctic. 
And when there are clouds, we need to look at what feeds them : aerosols !

  I like to code and especially try to make my code readable and sharable with ease. I think that research needs open science and open-minded scientists. 
Let's share together then.
  
### 🍃 I’m currently learning 🍃 

  I'm trying to develop some methods to assess the cloud-aerosol interaction impact on the effective radiative forcing of the Earth.

### ☁️ What are my interests ? ☁️ 

  I'm into **clouds** obviously.
